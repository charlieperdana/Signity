# Signity — Uniting Communication
Signity is an iOS app that helps people learn BISINDO from different regions in Indonesia. Providing visual learning module & real-time practice by machine learning gesture recognition. Currently, Signity is available at the Test Flight app as an iOS app which can be accessed [here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/nKoERm9C) or by scanning the QR Code above.

The machine learning model uses Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) as the main layer, followed by 2 Dense layers having 128 and 64 nodes, respectively. The model was trained for 50 epochs using the datasets we created ourselves. The detailed training process can be accessed at [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EUFq73viET9EQ0Tz5LavVQskTkFIUr__?usp=sharing)
